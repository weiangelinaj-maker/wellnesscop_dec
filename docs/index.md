## What does a Community of Practice (CoP) set out to do differently — and why?

Much of contemporary social impact work relies on a **“fixing” paradigm**:
communities or individuals are implicitly framed as broken and in need of external intervention.

The Wellbeing Community of Practice intentionally rejects this framing.

Instead, we ground our work in **community actualization** — a model informed by the pedagogy of the **Blackfoot (Siksika) Nation**, which assumes that people are **born whole** and enter the work as contributors, not recipients.

The CoP supports people in **showing up differently**, shifting nonprofit culture from:
> chronic overwhelm → collective care

## The biological infrastructure for change

Sustainable systems change requires more than good intentions — it requires the **right physiological conditions**.

By explicitly centering the concepts below, we create the biological and relational infrastructure needed for trust, collaboration, and innovation.

### 1. Psychological safety & authenticity  
🌱 *Low lift, high return*

- Move from a culture of “fixing” to a **playground of acceptance**
- Create conditions where people can take interpersonal risks **without fear of humiliation**
- Establish a clear norm:
  - **Authenticity is required**
  - **Perfection is not**
- Include a *“no masking” mandate* — people do not need to suppress identity, emotion, or experience to belong

---

### 2. Addressing moral injury (not just burnout)  
🔧 *High lift, necessary repair*

- Burnout is often treated as an individual resource problem  
- **Moral injury** occurs when people must suppress who they are to survive harmful systems
- Masking is **metabolically expensive**:
  - drains cognitive resources
  - reduces empathy
  - blocks innovation

**Why this distinction matters:**

| Experience | What’s needed |
|----------|---------------|
| Burnout | Rest |
| Moral Injury | Play, repair, and belonging |

### 3. The ventral vagal (safe & social) state  
🌱 *Foundational for systems change*

When people are supported to be:
- open
- curious
- flexible  

…we activate the **ventral vagal state** of the nervous system.

This is the *only* physiological state in which humans can:
- engage in complex thinking
- hold nuance
- collaborate across difference
- design durable systems change

---

## Radical acceptance: the shift from “fixing” to belonging

Traditional systems change often operates on **conditional acceptance**:
> “You are welcome once you change x, y, or z.”

This message — even when implicit — triggers **neurobiological defense responses**:
- fight
- flight
- shutdown

A **Playground of Acceptance and Belonging** is not abstract or aspirational.  
It is a **scientifically grounded design strategy** for regulating the collective nervous system.

### What changes when acceptance is unconditional?

- People move out of *fight-or-flight*
- The prefrontal cortex comes back online
- Empathy, creativity, and collaboration become possible

---

## Nervous system states & why they matter

### Fight or Flight (Sympathetic Nervous System)
- Amygdala hijack
- Rigid, binary thinking
- Reduced capacity for collaboration

### Rest & Digest (Ventral Vagal State)
- “Safe and social”
- Resources available for creativity and planning
- Required for complex systems work

---

## Reframing the hierarchy of needs

Drawing from the **Blackfoot (Siksika) Nation’s model**:

- Western frameworks place *self-actualization at the peak*
- Blackfoot pedagogy places **self-actualization at the foundation**

This foundation enables:
1. Individual self-actualization  
2. Community actualization  
3. Cultural perpetuity  

> Self-actualization is not the reward — it is the starting point.

---

## How the CoP puts this into practice

The Community of Practice uses **intentional, relational strategies** to support safety and connection.

### Core practices include:

1. **Facilitation with intentionality**  
   Facilitators act as *biological anchors*, broadcasting calm and safety through their regulated presence.

2. **Modeling & mirroring**  
   Through mirror neurons, a regulated leader helps others shift out of fight-or-flight and into social engagement.

3. **Skill sharing over expertise**  
   - Moves away from expert/client binaries  
   - Redistributes power  
   - Uplifts collective wisdom  

   Key skills include:
   - co-regulation
   - compassionate curiosity
   - repair after rupture

## The “good virus” effect

Radical acceptance functions as a **“good virus”** through **upstream reciprocity**.

When people feel genuinely supported:
- they are more likely to support others
- cooperative behavior spreads up to **three degrees of separation** in a social network

Ultimately:
> People can only show up differently **after** they themselves are met with acceptance.

The playground is the incubator.
