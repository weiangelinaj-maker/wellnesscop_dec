## What does CoP set out to do differently, and why? 
The contemporary approach to social impact often relies on a "fixing" paradigm that identifies communities or individuals as broken entities requiring external intervention. 

To ensure work is rooted in the people most impacted, we must shift toward a model of community actualization, reflective of the pedagogy of the Blackfoot Nation, which assumes people are born whole and enter the work as actualized contributors rather than needy recipients. The Trust and Wellbeing Community of Practice (CoP) is an intentional way to support people in showing up differently by shifting the nonprofit sector's culture from overwhelming stress to collective care.

By explicitly centering the following concepts, we create the biological infrastructure for change:
1. Psychological Safety and Authenticity: We must move beyond "fixing" to a "playground of acceptance" where psychological safety allows for interpersonal risk-taking without fear of humiliation. This includes a "no masking" mandate, explicitly stating that authenticity is required while perfection is not.
2. Addressing Moral Injury: A big moral injury occurs when individuals must suppress their authentic identities to survive within harmful systems. This "masking" is metabolically expensive, draining the cognitive resources needed for innovation and empathy.
3. The Ventral Vagal State: When we encourage being open, curious, and flexible, specifically through practices like compassionate curiosity, we activate the "ventral vagal" state of social engagement. This enables the complex thinking required for systems change.

Radical Acceptance: We must embrace the reality that things don’t always work perfectly. 

The traditional "fixing" paradigm in systems change operates on the assumption that communities or individuals are broken entities. This mindset often imposes conditional acceptance; the unspoken message of "we will accept you only if you change x, y, or z, " triggers deep-seated neurobiological defense mechanisms. In contrast, a "Playground of Acceptance and Belonging" is a scientifically grounded architectural strategy designed to regulate the collective central nervous system (CNS). By intentionally creating a space that prioritizes authenticity and psychological safety, we can move from "fight or flight" into a "rest and digest" state (the Ventral Vagal state), which is the only physiological condition where the human brain can engage in the higher-order thinking and empathy required for complex systems change.

Asking if it’s burnout or moral injury
Burnout → rest 
Moral Injury → play & moral repair

The Necessity of "Rest and Digest"
Fight or Flight (Sympathetic Nervous System): In this state, the "amygdala hijack" overrides the prefrontal cortex, resulting in rigid, binary thinking and a loss of the nuance needed for collaboration.
Rest and Digest (Ventral Vagal State): This "Safe and Social" state allows metabolic resources to support creativity and complex planning.
The Hierarchy of Needs: Following the Blackfoot (Siksika) Nation's model, we move from the Western view of individual self-actualization as a "peak" to a model where. Self-actualization is the foundation (the Base of the Tipi). This foundation supports Community Actualization, leading ultimately to Cultural Perpetuity.

To support people in feeling genuinely supported, the Community of Practice (CoP) employs specific, intentional practices:
1. Facilitation with Intentionality: Facilitators act as "biological anchors," centering calm and solutions to broadcast a neuroceptive signal of safety to others.
2. Modeling and Mirroring: Using mirror neurons, a leader’s regulated state can be "contagious," helping others transition from "fight or flight" into social engagement.
3. Skill Sharing: The CoP shifts from an "expert/client" binary to communal skill sharing, redistributing power and uplifting collective wisdom. Specific skills include co-regulation (managing distressing emotions) and compassionate curiosity (actively listening to seek understanding).

The "Good Virus"

Radical acceptance acts as a "good virus" through a mechanism called upstream reciprocity. When individuals feel supported and appreciated, they reciprocate that support to others, spreading cooperative behavior up to three degrees of separation within a social network. Ultimately, for people in the ecosystem to show up differently, they must first receive acceptance themselves; the "playground" is the essential incubator for this transformation.
