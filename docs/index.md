**What the Wellbeing Community of Practice Is Trying to Do**

Traditional social impact work often operates on a "fixing" paradigm, viewing communities as broken entities in need of external intervention. We reject this. Guided by the pedagogy of the Blackfoot (Siksika) Nation, we begin with the belief that people are born whole and enter this work as actualized contributors. Our goal is to shift the nonprofit sector from a culture of overwhelming stress to one of collective care.

The Biology of Systems Change 
Lasting change requires more than good ideas; it requires a nervous system capable of collaboration. When individuals are in "survival mode" (Fight or Flight), the brain’s ability to plan, innovate, and empathize shuts down. Complex problem-solving is only biologically possible when we feel safe, connected, and regulated (the Ventral Vagal state).

Three Areas of Focus:

*Psychological Safety:* We create a "playground of acceptance" where authenticity is required. When people stop expending energy on masking who they are, they regain the cognitive resources needed for innovation.

*Distinguishing Burnout from Moral Injury:*
- Burnout is exhaustion that requires rest.
- Moral Injury is a violation of values that requires repair, play, and belonging. We address the latter by reducing the need to suppress one's identity to survive harmful systems.

*Inverting the Hierarchy:* Self-Actualization is the foundation that supports Community Actualization and Cultural Perpetuity.

## Why biology matters for systems change

Lasting change does not happen through ideas alone. It also depends on whether people feel safe enough, connected enough, and regulated enough to work together.

When people are under constant stress, collaboration and creativity shut down.  
When people feel supported, trust and problem-solving become possible.

The Community of Practice focuses on three foundational conditions.

---

## 1. Psychological safety and authenticity  
🌱 Low lift, high impact

Psychological safety allows people to speak honestly, ask questions, and take interpersonal risks without fear of embarrassment or punishment.

In practice:
- people are not expected to hide parts of themselves to belong
- authenticity is encouraged
- perfection is not required

When people do not have to mask who they are, they conserve energy, stay engaged, and participate more fully.

---

## 2. Burnout is often treated as an individual problem that can be solved with rest or self-care.

Moral injury is different.  
It occurs when people are asked to violate their values or suppress their identity in order to function within a system.

Masking and self-silencing are costly. They drain attention, reduce empathy, and make meaningful change harder.

The distinction matters:

- Burnout often requires rest.
- Moral injury requires belonging, repair, and the ability to play and experiment safely.

---

## 3. Supporting the safe and social nervous system  

When people feel safe, their nervous systems shift into a state that supports connection and flexibility.

In this state, people are more able to:
- think clearly
- tolerate uncertainty
- collaborate across differences
- design complex solutions

This is the biological state that makes systems change possible.

---

## From conditional acceptance to real belonging

Many systems operate on conditional acceptance.  
People are welcomed only after they change how they act, speak, or present themselves.

Even when unspoken, this expectation creates stress and defensiveness.

Unconditional acceptance is a strategy that helps groups stay regulated and engaged.

When people feel accepted:
- threat responses decrease
- curiosity increases
- collaboration becomes easier

---

## Nervous system states and their effects

**High threat states**
- narrow attention
- rigid thinking
- difficulty collaborating

**Safe and social states**
- openness and flexibility
- access to creativity
- capacity for long-term planning

Communities that want to do complex work must intentionally support the second state.

---

## Reframing the hierarchy of needs

Western models often place self-actualization at the top of a pyramid, as something earned after basic needs are met. Blackfoot pedagogy reverses this logic and self-actualization is the foundation.

When people are supported to feel whole and capable:
1. individuals thrive
2. communities strengthen
3. cultures sustain themselves over time

---

## How the Community of Practice works in practice

The Community of Practice uses relational strategies to support safety and connection.

Key practices include:

1. **Intentional facilitation**  
   Facilitators model calm, curiosity, and steadiness. Their presence helps others regulate.

2. **Modeling and mirroring**  
   Regulated leadership supports regulated participation. People take cues from one another.

3. **Skill sharing rather than expertise hierarchies**  
   Knowledge is shared across roles and experience levels. Power is distributed rather than concentrated.

Skills emphasized include:
- co-regulation
- compassionate curiosity
- repair after conflict

---

## How change spreads

Acceptance and support tend to multiply.

When people feel genuinely supported, they are more likely to extend that support to others.  
This effect spreads through relationships and networks.

People are able to show up differently only after they themselves have been met with care.

The Community of Practice creates the conditions where this becomes possible.
