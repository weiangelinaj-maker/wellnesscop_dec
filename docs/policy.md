### **Part 1: The Oxygen Mask (Staff Wellbeing & Resilience)**

Goal: Proactively maintaining the "Window of Tolerance" to mitigate secondary trauma.

| Lift | Practice | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 📝 | **Monitor Your Levels** | Use the **Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL)** regularly to measure compassion satisfaction vs. fatigue.|
| 🟢 | **Micro-Breaks (The 90-Second Reset)** | Take 90 seconds to deep breathe or do a sensory check (e.g., splash cold water on face) to exit "Survival Mode".|
| 🟢 | **Complete the Stress Cycle** | Use rhythm, movement, or creative expression to release stored trauma. Active joy (dancing/singing) is more restorative than passive rest.|
| 🟢 | **Meeting Rituals** | Start every meeting with a "Check-in" (feelings/intentions) and end with a "Check-out" (needs/transition).|
| 🟢 | **Co-Regulation** | When a colleague is distressed, offer a calm presence. Validate ("That sounds hard") rather than trying to "fix" it immediately.|
| 🟢 | **Relationship Repair** | If trust is broken, acknowledge the harm and listen without defending before co-creating a solution.|
| 🔴 | **Mandatory Time Off** | Implement policies requiring staff to utilize vacation time to prevent burnout.|

---

### **Part 2: The Safe House (Internal Policy & Culture)**

Goal: Institutionalizing support so wellbeing isn't just an individual responsibility.

| Lift | Policy Area | Specific Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🟢 | **Hiring** | Explicitly reference trauma-informed practices in job descriptions.|
| 🟢 | **Evaluation** | Integrate benchmarks for social justice and compassion into annual performance reviews, not just productivity metrics.|
| 🔴 | **Supervision Structure** | <br>**Split Supervision Roles:** Distinctly separate Clinical Supervision (emotional support) from Administrative Supervision (paperwork/billing).|
| 🔴 | **Safety Protocols** | Establish clear policies for when staff are alone/conducting visits. Ensure physical exits are accessible.|
| 🔴 | **Fix the EAP** | Review Employee Assistance Programs. Actively communicate confidentiality to overcome mistrust and low utilization.|
| 🔴 | **Restorative Justice** | Implement conflict resolution policies rooted in healing/repair rather than punitive measures.|

---

### **Part 3: The Work (Service Delivery & Client Interactions)**

Goal: Moving from symptom suppression to restoring identity and empowerment.

| Lift | Practice | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🟢 | **Shift the Question** | Move from "What’s wrong with you?" to "What happened to you?" to reframe behavior as a survival response.|
| 🟢 | **The Miracle Question** | Ask: "If this problem disappeared overnight, what would be different?" to identify small goals.|
| 🟢 | **Maximize Choice** | Offer clients choice in timing, location, or method whenever possible to restore agency.|
| 📝 | **Safety Plans** | Assist every client in creating a low-barrier Personal Safety Plan for coping when overwhelmed.|
| 📝 | **Sanctuary Safety Check** | Evaluate your space for Physical, Psychological, Social, and Moral safety.|
| 🔴 | **Housing First** | Recognize stability is a precursor to healing.|
